/**
 * dsh-providers-live-models: keep OpenCode Go, Zen and native OpenAI Codex
 * model catalogs current without waiting for a pi-ai or DSH release.
 *
 * ## What it patches, and why that is enough
 *
 * DSH's `llm-pi-ai` adapter builds a pi-ai `Models` collection per operation and
 * reads every catalog fact from it:
 *
 * - `listModels()`  -> `snapshot.models.getModels(provider)`
 * - `resolveModel()` -> `snapshot.models.getModel(provider, id)`
 * - dispatch        -> `snapshot.models.streamSimple(model, ...)`
 *
 * In pi-ai both `getModels(provider)` and `getModel(provider, id)` delegate to the
 * registered provider's own `getModels()` (`ModelsImpl.getModel` is literally
 * `getModels(provider).find(m => m.id === id)`), and `setProvider()` swaps a
 * provider at runtime. Replacing the `opencode-go` provider with one whose
 * `getModels()` returns a merged roster therefore reaches the model picker, the
 * capability queries, and dispatch, **without reimplementing any transport**: a
 * model the old pi-ai has never heard of is carried by the old pi-ai's existing
 * `openai-completions` / `openai-responses` / `anthropic-messages` transports.
 *
 * ## The two request rewrites
 *
 * Catalog work is only half of what the gateway needs. `opencode.ai` refuses a
 * request that arrives without `x-opencode-session` (`400 MissingSessionID`), and
 * pi-ai's own injection for that header is bound to the two provider descriptors
 * pi-ai ships — so a route configured for the same gateway under a custom id, or
 * one built over the protocol table because it names an `api`, reaches the
 * gateway without it. Separately, pi-ai defaults `cacheRetention` to `'short'`,
 * which sends neither `prompt_cache_key` nor `prompt_cache_retention`, leaving a
 * session on the gateway's own ~5-minute window instead of the hours to days the
 * official endpoint keeps. Both are merged in on the way through: the session
 * headers on the `Models` prototype, which no collection rebuild replaces, and
 * the cache option on the `opencode-go` provider wrapper. Neither touches a
 * request that does not match it.
 *
 * Codex uses the same overlay with its native `openai-codex-responses`
 * transport and OAuth. It reads only Pi's public catalog, never an
 * authenticated account roster, and receives no OpenCode request patches.
 *
 * ## No host-package imports
 *
 * This module imports only local subscription modules, and the reason is testability rather
 * than necessity — worth being precise about, because the obvious justification
 * is false. The host *does* route `@deepseek-ai/*` to its own copies:
 * `dsh-app-boot` patches Node's CommonJS and ESM resolvers so a profile plugin
 * can import host packages that live inside `app.asar`, and `dsh-shell` relies
 * on exactly that with no declared dependencies.
 *
 * What does not work is importing one *here*. `probe.mjs` loads this module in a
 * plain Node process, with no host and no `node_modules` anywhere above the
 * checkout, so a top-level host import fails to resolve and takes the whole suite
 * with it before the first assertion runs.
 *
 * So catalog updates reach the running pi-ai instance through
 * `ctx.llm.adapters` — a TypeScript-`private` field that is an ordinary Map at
 * runtime. Staying loadable outside the host is what lets the merge, validation
 * and degrade logic be tested directly instead of through the client.
 *
 * ## Sources, in priority order
 *
 * 1. `https://pi.dev/api/models/providers/<provider>?types=chat` — Pi's own
 *    catalog, carrying complete descriptors (capacities, compat,
 *    thinkingLevelMap). Authoritative and pre-verified by Pi. It decides which
 *    models exist and what they can do; the scope's `apiBaseUrls` decides where
 *    requests go, so the remote cannot redirect traffic.
 * 2. The installed catalog, untouched, so a model Pi has not published yet is
 *    never dropped from the picker just because the remote fetch was partial.
 *
 * Nothing is bundled: the overlay is exactly what Pi currently publishes, so an
 * id added, renamed or retired upstream needs no change in this file.
 *
 * `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/models` and `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/models`
 * supply the live rosters, gated by {@link acceptRoster} because a roster alone
 * decides which *installed* models survive. Pi's own entries are exempt — see
 * {@link buildOverlay} for why a gateway gap is not read as a retirement. A name
 * with no descriptor is reported, not guessed.
 *
 * ## Independent provider scopes
 *
 * `opencode-go` and `opencode` are *different wire endpoints* rather than two
 * names for one: Go forwards Anthropic, OpenAI-completions and OpenAI-responses
 * traffic to `/zen/go`, while `opencode` is OpenCode Zen and carries a fourth
 * protocol (Google's) to `/zen`. So each gets its own entry in
 * {@link PROVIDER_SCOPES} — its own catalog URL, its own roster URL, its own
 * protocol table and its own slice of {@link state}. They poll together and
 * publish together, and one scope's outage or refused payload never touches
 * another's catalog. Codex has its own catalog and protocol table, with no
 * gateway roster. Only the providers DSH actually registered are polled: a
 * route that is configured nowhere must not be fetched on every tick.
 *
 * ## Ordering
 *
 * Appending the overlay would read as two blocks, because `Map.set` never moves
 * an existing key and the overlay can therefore only append. So the roster is
 * ordered on purpose: Pi's catalog order is the spine, a model only the
 * installed catalog carries is inserted before its nearest following spine
 * entry, and anything without an anchor goes last. See {@link orderModels}.

/**
 * The routes this plugin keeps current, in the order they are reported.
 *
 * Each entry is a scope: an identity (`id`), the two feeds it is fed from, and
 * the table that decides where each wire protocol's requests go. The tables are
 * not interchangeable — Zen's Anthropic traffic goes to the bare `/zen` root
 * while Go's goes to `/zen/go`, and each one carries a protocol the other does
 * not (Zen: Google's; Go: none) — which is why this is a table of scopes rather
 * than one entry with a provider id in it.
 *
 * `id` is the provider id on both sides: the key DSH registers the route under
 * in its adapter registry, and the value pi-ai's collection keys providers by.
 * A scope whose id matches no registered adapter is never polled — see
 * {@link activeScopes}.
 *
 * `apiBaseUrls` doubles as the trust boundary. A descriptor naming a protocol
 * its scope's map does not carry is dropped before any other field reaches a
 * transport, so a remote catalog decides *which* models exist and what they can
 * do, never where a request is sent.
 *
 * `google-generative-ai` rides the installed pi-ai's own Google transport with
 * the base URL Pi publishes for it (`/zen/v1`, which already includes the
 * version path — that transport sets `apiVersion: ''` precisely because its
 * `baseUrl` carries it). `typesafe-system-one` is a protocol pi-ai 0.87.1 has
 * no implementation for; the mapping is inert today and becomes live the moment
 * a pi-ai release registers it. Without it those entries would be dropped as
 * untrustworthy rather than as un-implemented, and the log would blame the
 * remote for the local gap.
 * `rosterUrl: null` means catalog-only discovery. Codex's public Pi catalog
 * needs no credential; its native provider still owns OAuth and dispatch.
